# 100 Days of Coding

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding challenge repository! In this repository, I will be documenting my coding journey as I take on the challenge of coding consistently for 100 days. This challenge is a great opportunity for me to improve my programming skills, work on personal projects, and explore new technologies.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Coding challenge involves coding and learning for at least an hour every day for 100 days straight. This challenge aims to build consistency, improve coding skills, and help participants achieve their coding goals.

## Repository Structure

- **Day_X:** Each day of my coding journey will have a dedicated folder with the date (e.g., Day_01, Day_02, ...). Inside each folder, I will document what I worked on, challenges faced, and what I learned.

- **Projects:** This folder will contain any coding projects I work on during the challenge. Each project will have its own sub-folder with the project name.

## Goals

- Improve proficiency in programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
- Work on personal coding projects to apply and reinforce my skills.
- Learn new technologies and concepts.
- Share my progress and insights with the coding community.

## Follow Along

You're welcome to follow along with my 100 Days of Coding journey! Feel free to explore the daily folders to see my progress, challenges, and achievements. If you have any suggestions, or feedback, or want to connect, don't hesitate to reach out.

## Log
- **Day_0:** Did research and began planning for my journey ahead. My journey is being recorded on my Linkedin page.
- **Day_1:** Started the To-Do List app. Excited for how big I can make this app. Starting small and enjoying the ride. Gonna code at least an hour a day and make it a stressless experience.
- **Day_2:** Came across a weird bug with the "mark completed" functionality, but I will tackle it tomorrow. Learned more about the OS library in Python and the ANSI escape codes. Also started implementing the try/exception into my code for good practice and habit.
