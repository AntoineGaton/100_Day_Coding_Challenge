# 100 Days of Coding

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding challenge repository! In this repository, I will be documenting my coding journey as I take on the challenge of coding consistently for 100 days. This challenge is a great opportunity for me to improve my programming skills, work on personal projects, and explore new technologies.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Coding challenge involves coding and learning for at least an hour every day for 100 days straight. This challenge aims to build consistency, improve coding skills, and help participants achieve their coding goals.

## Repository Structure

- **Day_X:** Each day of my coding journey will have a dedicated folder with the date (e.g., Day_01, Day_02, ...). Inside each folder, I will document what I worked on, challenges faced, and what I learned.

- **Projects:** This folder will contain any coding projects I work on during the challenge. Each project will have its own sub-folder with the project name.

## Goals

- Improve proficiency in programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
- Work on personal coding projects to apply and reinforce my skills.
- Learn new technologies and concepts.
- Share my progress and insights with the coding community.
